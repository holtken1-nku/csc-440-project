Please create a file structure that consists of the following folders:
  - Source_Code
  - Data
  - Supporting_Documentation
  - Project_Schedule
  - Screen_Shots_and_Readme
  - Other

Place your files in the appropriate folders.

  - You may organize the folder/files however you see best within these folders (for example, for **Source Code**, you can create however many folders or files you want that is natural to your project/implementation). 

  - The **Data** folder should contain supporting data/datasets that your code is working/processing on.  For example, this could be raw data (used in data mining), database tables/queries, etc., or flat files. 

    - If the dataset is large, please truncate it to just a relatively small sample for sake of hard drive space.  I'll get the idea! 

  - The **Screen_Shots** folder should contain Screenshots of the code being compiled in on your platform.  If the code doesn't compile or build, it's appropriate to take screen shots (or a text log) of errors showing your steps. 

    -  The readme.txt file should contain instructions on how to compile/build the project if it was to be assembled from scratch. 
        Please also take a few sample screenshots of the application running.

      - It doesn't have to be comprehensive because your Project Presentation will likely have more detail.  A few samples should suffice.

        - If it doesn't run, then show some screen shots of the errors (or a text log if more appropriate).

  - Use the **Other** category to put any kind of miscellaneous files. 

    - If you don't have documents that would go into one or more of the folders (ex. not every group will have a formal project schedule or 'other' documentation), it's okay if the folder is empty.

Please use the .zip format to archive/zip your files. Please name it CSC440_Implementation_Team_[Team Number}.zip.  For example, CSC440_Implementation_Team_1.zip.    I generally use 7zip (but it's not necessary to use 7zip if you have another tool you prefer).
